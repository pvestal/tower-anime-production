"""Model selector — checkpoint and parameter recommendation from learned data.

Uses generation_history and learned_patterns to:
- Recommend the best checkpoint for a character/project
- Suggest parameter overrides based on historical success
- Detect quality drift and flag characters needing attention
- Provide learned negative prompt additions from DB rejection patterns
- Explore alternative checkpoints and rank them by quality/approval rate

All functions are async, use the shared connection pool, and never raise.
