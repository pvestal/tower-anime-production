# Tower Anime Production - Reorganization Plan

## Current Problem
- 120+ files in root directory
- Test files mixed with production code
- No clear workflow progression
- Multiple overlapping documentation files
- Experimental code cluttering workspace

## Proposed Structure

```

```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Structure (Immediate)
1. Create new directory structure
2. Move working workflows to production/
3. Archive failed experiments

### Phase 2: Document Gates (Next)
1. Create story-to-image pipeline with validation
2. Create image-to-video pipeline with validation
3. Document quality gates between steps

### Phase 3: Clean Production Pipeline (Final)
1. Remove all experimental files from root
2. Create clear entry points for each workflow
3. Document exactly what works and what doesn't

## Success Criteria
- Clear separation of working vs experimental code
- Story-to-video pipeline with validation gates
- New team member can understand structure in 5 minutes
- Zero confusion about what actually works
